## Current State vs Target State

### Current State
- Basic AI chatbot functional (EPIC-002)
- Static content presentation (EPIC-001)
- Interactive timeline and projects (EPIC-003)
- Resume content is fixed

### Target State
- Job Fit Analyzer: Paste JD â†’ Get match score + custom cover letter

## Technical Approach

### Tech Stack Additions
- **File Upload**: React Dropzone or native input for job descriptions
- **Progress Visualization**: Custom progress bars for match scores
- **Rich Text**: Markdown rendering for AI-generated content
- **State Persistence**: LocalStorage for generated content

### Architecture Decisions
1. Create dedicated API endpoints for each AI feature
2. Build reusable prompt templates for consistent AI responses
3. Cache generated content to reduce API costs
4. Implement loading states with progress indicators
5. Log all analyses to Supabase for improvement insights

### AI Prompting Strategy
- **Job Analyzer**: Structured prompts with skill extraction and matching
- **Resume Regenerator**: Content reordering and emphasis adjustment
- **Project Deep Dives**: Technical architecture explanation prompts
- **Smart Contact**: Behavioral analysis and message suggestion
