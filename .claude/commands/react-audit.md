You are conducting a comprehensive audit of this Next.js + TypeScript codebase against industry best practices and the guidelines defined in `knowledge/nextjs-typescript.md`.

Your task is to analyze the entire codebase and generate a detailed `REACT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` file with actionable recommendations.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Read Guidelines
First, read `knowledge/nextjs-typescript.md` to understand all best practices.

### 2. Explore Codebase Structure
Use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to systematically discover:
- All React components in `app/`, `components/`, and subdirectories
- TypeScript configuration and type definitions
- API routes and data fetching patterns
- Custom hooks and utilities
- State management implementations

### 3. Analyze Against Best Practices

For each category, evaluate:

**Component Architecture:**
- Server vs Client component usage (`'use client'` directives)
- Props interface typing (proper TypeScript interfaces)
- Component composition patterns
- File naming conventions (PascalCase for components)

**TypeScript Quality:**
- Presence of `any` types (should be avoided)
- Return type annotations on functions
- Type safety in API routes and data fetching
- Proper use of generics and utility types

**State Management:**
- useState/useReducer patterns
- Context API implementation and typing
- Custom hooks (proper naming with `use` prefix)

**Data Fetching:**
- Server Component data fetching (async components)
- Client-side fetching patterns (fetch, SWR, etc.)
- Error handling in data operations
- API route implementations with validation

**Performance:**
- Image optimization (Next.js Image component usage)
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- Memoization (useMemo, useCallback, React.memo)
- Lazy loading patterns

**Project Structure:**
- Directory organization clarity
- File colocation
- Path alias usage (@/*)
- Separation of concerns (components, services, utilities)

**Security:**
- Environment variable handling
- Input validation (Zod or similar)
- API route security
- Error messages (no sensitive data exposure)

### 4. Document Findings

Create `REACT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` with this structure:

```markdown

## Code Quality Checklist

Use for all future development:

**TypeScript:**
- [ ] No `any` types without justification
- [ ] All function parameters and returns typed
- [ ] Props interfaces defined for all components
- [ ] Proper error type handling in try-catch

**Components:**
- [ ] Server/Client components correctly designated
- [ ] Components under 250 lines
- [ ] Reusable logic extracted to hooks
- [ ] Proper use of React.memo when needed

**Performance:**
- [ ] Images use next/image
- [ ] Heavy components dynamically imported
- [ ] Expensive calculations memoized
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders

**Data & APIs:**
- [ ] API routes validate input
- [ ] Proper error handling in data fetching
- [ ] Type-safe API responses
- [ ] Rate limiting where appropriate

**Security:**
- [ ] Env variables properly typed and used
- [ ] User input sanitized
- [ ] No sensitive data in client code
- [ ] CORS configured correctly

**Next Review:** Re-run audit in 4 weeks after implementing critical fixes.
```

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Be thorough** - Analyze ALL components and files, not just a sample
2. **Be specific** - Always include exact file paths and line numbers
3. **Be practical** - Provide concrete, copy-paste-ready code examples
4. **Be prioritized** - Use severity levels consistently
5. **Be constructive** - Frame as opportunities for improvement
6. **Be contextual** - Consider this project uses Claude AI, Supabase, Netlify

## After Generating Report

1. Write the `REACT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` file
2. Summarize the top 3-5 critical findings
3. Recommend which issue to tackle first based on effort vs impact
4. Offer to implement the highest priority fix
