## 🎓 Best Practices

### When Creating New Stories/Tasks

1. **Be Specific**: Agent prompts should be executable without clarification
2. **Include Context**: Always explain the "why" not just the "what"
3. **Add Verification**: Include how to verify the work is done correctly
4. **Estimate Realistically**: Use the Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
5. **Link Related Docs**: Reference the plan.md and epics-index.md

### When Executing Tasks

1. **Read the Entire Task**: Don't skip the context section
2. **Follow the Agent Prompt**: It's designed to be copy-pasted to AI
3. **Verify Your Work**: Complete all verification steps
4. **Commit Frequently**: Use the provided commit message format
5. **Update Status**: Mark tasks/stories complete as you finish

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Skipping verification steps
- ❌ Not testing on mobile devices
- ❌ Forgetting to update .env.example
- ❌ Implementing features not in acceptance criteria (scope creep)
- ❌ Not checking accessibility
- ❌ Ignoring TypeScript errors
