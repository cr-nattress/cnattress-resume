Guidelines for Outstanding Web/API Project README Files
Introduction: A high-quality README is vital for setting the tone of a project and helping users quickly understand and use the software. To gather best practices, we analyzed ten exemplary README files from popular open-source projects in web and API development (spanning TypeScript, JavaScript, C#, and Python). These projects include frameworks like Express (Node.js) and Fastify, full-stack tools like NestJS and refine, web applications like Ghost, API frameworks like FastAPI, utilities like HTTPie and Requests, and .NET libraries like Ocelot and GraphQL for .NET. Each of these README files demonstrates effective structure, clarity, and presentation. This guide distills their approaches into actionable recommendations.
Section-by-Section Breakdown of an Ideal README
A great README is typically organized into clear sections. Below is an ideal structure with guidance and examples for each part:
1. Project Introduction and Overview
Start with the project name, a one-line description, and often a tagline or short pitch. This section should immediately answer what the project is and why it matters. Many projects include badges (shields) right at the top to display status and key info (build status, version, license, downloads, etc.) for quick insight.
Project Name and Tagline: Use a heading for the project name, followed by a brief description. For example, the NestJS framework README begins with a bold tagline: “A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.”
github.com
. Similarly, the refine project starts with a clear statement of purpose: “A React Framework for building internal tools, admin panels, dashboards & B2B apps with unmatched flexibility.”
github.com
.
Badges: Immediately under the tagline, include badges for important metrics or integrations. These can show version, build passing, coverage, downloads, etc. For instance, Express.js displays NPM version, downloads, build status, test coverage, and an OpenSSF scorecard badge at a glance
github.com
. Badges provide quick credibility and status information.
Logo or Banner (Optional): If available, include a project logo or a banner image to make the README more visually engaging. Some projects use a graphic header – for example, Ghost’s README features a polished banner illustrating the product’s branding and interface
https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost
. Visual branding helps make the project memorable.
Table of Contents: For longer READMEs, a Table of Contents helps with navigation. It should list the main sections with anchor links. Express.js, for example, provides a TOC right after the introduction, listing sections like Installation, Features, Docs & Community, Quick Start, etc.
github.com
. Fastify’s README also includes a concise table of contents for sections such as Quick Start, Install, Example, Core Features, Benchmarks, and more
github.com
. A TOC is especially useful when the README is extensive, allowing readers to jump to relevant sections easily.
2. Installation and Quick Start
After introducing the project, provide instructions to install or set up the software. This section should be simple and copy-paste friendly, helping users get started immediately.
Prerequisites: Mention any required environments or dependencies if applicable. (E.g., Node.js version, Python version, etc. Express notes that Node.js 18+ is required
github.com
.)
Install Command: Provide the common installation steps. Use code blocks or shell commands for clarity. For example, Express shows how to install via npm: npm install express
github.com
, and FastAPI shows installing via pip: pip install "fastapi[standard]"
github.com
. Ensure the command is up to date and correct.
Quick Start Example: Many READMEs include a quick-start snippet or a minimal example that produces a “Hello World” output. This gives users instant gratification and a concrete idea of usage. For instance:
Express includes a short Node.js code example that starts a web server returning "Hello World", right in the README
github.com
.
Flask’s README demonstrates a simple app route and running the development server in just a few lines of code
github.com
.
Fastify provides a quick scaffold example using npm init fastify followed by how to run the dev server
github.com
github.com
.
Alternate Installation Methods: If relevant, mention other installation options (like Docker, CLI tools, etc.). Ghost’s README, for example, suggests using their CLI for setup and provides both local and production install commands
github.com
, linking to detailed docs for each scenario.
By the end of this section, a new user should have the project installed and a basic instance running.
3. Usage, Examples, and Basic API Usage
Provide examples of how to use the project in practice. Depending on the project, this could be basic usage of the API, or example commands, or snippet demonstrating key functionality.
Code Examples: Showing typical usage in code is very effective. FastAPI’s README, for instance, includes a simple API example (creating an app with a couple of GET endpoints) under an Example heading
github.com
github.com
. This example is immediately followed by instructions on how to run the development server and see results, complete with expected output logs and URLs
github.com
github.com
. This helps users confirm everything is working.
Command Examples: For CLI tools, list example commands and their outputs. HTTPie’s README has an Examples section showing common use cases like making a GET request, using custom HTTP methods and headers, and even posting a comment via the GitHub API using HTTPie
github.com
github.com
. These examples are short, focused, and linked to further documentation for more details.
Screenshots or GIFs (Optional): If the project has a visual aspect (UI or output), consider adding a screenshot or animated GIF of it in action. Many “awesome” README examples include such media for demonstration. For instance, the README for an electron app includes a GIF demo of the app’s UI
github.com
. Animated GIFs can show workflows (like using a CLI or the interface of a web app) in a way text cannot. Ensure to caption or label the media appropriately. Always optimize images/GIFs for size.
Sample Outputs or Responses: If applicable, show the output of the example usage. FastAPI’s README guides the user to open the browser and see the JSON response from the example endpoint
github.com
, and even shows how to access the automatically generated documentation (Swagger UI) with a screenshot of it
github.com
. This gives users a clear expectation of results.
This section can be combined with “Installation” as a single Getting Started or split into Installation and Usage depending on the length. The key is to provide a minimal working example that users can build upon.
4. Features and Key Concepts
Highlight what makes the project special by listing its main features or design principles. This can be a bullet list or a short paragraph summary of capabilities.
Feature List: Bullet points are effective for listing features or advantages. For example, FastAPI’s README enumerates key features such as high performance, easy syntax, fewer bugs due to validation, and standards-based (OpenAPI) compliance
github.com
github.com
. Each point is brief but descriptive. Likewise, HTTPie lists features like expressive syntax, colorized output, JSON support, file uploads, proxies, etc.
github.com
, giving potential users a snapshot of what it can do.
Philosophy or Principles: Some projects include a short “Philosophy” or design principles section (as NestJS and Express do). Express, for instance, explains its philosophy of minimalism and flexibility in a dedicated section
github.com
. This helps users understand the guiding approach of the tool (e.g., “unopinionated and small core” in Express, versus NestJS noting it provides an out-of-the-box architecture inspired by Angular
github.com
github.com
).
Comparison or Benchmarks (Optional): In cases where performance is a selling point, including benchmarks or comparisons can be powerful. Fastify’s README contains a Benchmarks table comparing how many requests per second it can handle versus other frameworks
github.com
. The table, with versions and request/sec numbers, substantiates Fastify’s claim of being one of the fastest. If including such data, ensure it’s up-to-date and cite the source (Fastify links to their benchmarks repo
github.com
).
Keep the feature list concise; you can link to more comprehensive documentation if needed (e.g., “See all features →” linking to docs, as HTTPie does
github.com
github.com
).
5. Documentation and Support
Even a great README cannot hold all usage information, especially for large projects. This section should point users to where they can find more detailed documentation, as well as ways to get help.
Documentation Links: Provide a clear link to the official documentation site or docs folder. Django’s README, for example, directs users to the docs directory and the online docs, then gives a quick roadmap of how to approach them
github.com
. Many projects use a line like “Full documentation available at [project URL]” prominently near the top
github.com
. Next.js’s README keeps this very brief, simply linking to the website/docs
github.com
.
Guides or Tutorials: If there are specific getting-started guides or tutorials, mention them. Django outlines which tutorial files to read in order
github.com
. NestJS’s README points newbies to the official docs guide and even provides links in multiple languages
github.com
.
Community & Support Channels: List the channels where users can ask questions or discuss. This often includes: chat (Discord, Slack), forums, Stack Overflow tags, mailing lists, etc.
The HTTPie CLI README has a Community & Support section that invites users to Discord for questions, Twitter for updates, StackOverflow for Q&A, and GitHub Issues for bugs/requests
github.com
.
Next.js encourages users to join GitHub Discussions for ideas and questions, and their Discord server for live chat, explicitly reminding them that the Code of Conduct applies
github.com
.
Provide the links and a brief description (e.g. “Join our Discord server to chat with other users and maintainers
github.com
”).
FAQ/Knowledge Base: If the project’s README is very detailed, an embedded FAQ can be helpful (though this might also reside in docs). Some READMEs, like Choo’s (a small framework), even had an FAQ section built-in
github.com
. This is optional and depends on the project’s scope.
The goal of this section is to ensure users know where to turn if they need more info or assistance beyond the README. Clearly separating “Docs” and “Support” ensures the README doesn’t try to hold every detail, and users can self-serve their information needs.
6. Contributing Guidelines
If your project is open to contributions (open-source), include a section on how to contribute. This sets expectations for external contributors and guides them to the right resources.
Invitation and Thanks: Encourage contributions by showing appreciation. Ocelot’s README says, “We love to receive contributions from the community, so please keep them coming. Pull requests, issues, and commentary welcome!”
github.com
. This friendly tone makes contributors feel valued. Express similarly “welcomes all constructive contributions” and outlines the many forms they can take
github.com
.
Link to Contributing Docs: Most projects have a separate CONTRIBUTING.md or contributing guide. Point to it for detailed procedures (how to run tests, coding standards, commit message conventions, etc.). Express’s README directs developers to the Contributing Guide for technical details
github.com
. Next.js explicitly asks potential contributors to review the guidelines first
github.com
.
Good First Issues: If applicable, highlight issues suitable for first-time contributors. Next.js lists a search link for “good first issues” in their README
github.com
 – this lowers the barrier for newcomers to find a starting point.
Reporting Issues and Feature Requests: Tell users how to report bugs or request features (often via GitHub Issues). HTTPie’s README suggests checking existing issues/PRs and then creating a GitHub Issue using provided templates
github.com
.
Code of Conduct: If a Code of Conduct is in place, mention that it exists and that contributors are expected to adhere to it. Many READMEs include it in the repository files navigation or in the contributing section (GitHub often auto-displays it, as seen in refine’s repo navigation
github.com
). For example, Next.js reminds in the community section that the Code of Conduct applies to all community channels
github.com
.
For internal or closed-source projects, a “Contributing” section might be unnecessary or abbreviated. But for any collaborative project, setting these guidelines in the README (or linking to them) is best practice to manage community contributions smoothly.
7. License and Acknowledgments
Conclude the README with the license information and any acknowledgments or credits. This is usually the final section.
License: Clearly state the project’s license and link to the license file. This can be a simple one-liner (e.g., “Licensed under the MIT License”). Many READMEs have a dedicated License section. For instance, NestJS notes, “Nest is MIT licensed.”
github.com
. FastAPI similarly states the MIT license in one sentence
github.com
. If the license is uncommon or there are multiple components with different licenses, clarify here (Django’s README lists two licenses: one for the framework and one for code in LICENSE.python
github.com
).
Acknowledgments or Credits: If appropriate, credit major contributors, inspirations, or funding sources. Some projects include a list of contributors or maintainers in the README (Express lists its core team and contributors in detail
github.com
github.com
, but this can also be in a separate file or GitHub’s contributor graph). You might thank sponsors or backers here as well, though larger projects often have a separate section for that:
Sponsors/Backers: Projects like refine and GraphQL .NET include badges or images for sponsors and a call to “Become a backer” with Open Collective
github.com
. If your project is open-source and funded, a short sponsors section can be included (Ghost thanks its sponsors within the README
github.com
).
Attribution: If your project is a fork or owes credit to other projects, note that. GraphQL for .NET credits the original author of its lexer/parser and the GraphQL spec foundation in the introduction
github.com
.
Putting license and credits last follows the convention users expect. It’s information people can find easily when needed, but it doesn’t distract from usage instructions.
(Optional) Additional Sections
Depending on the project, you might include extra sections. Use these judiciously to avoid clutter:
FAQ: Frequently asked questions, if user confusion is common and not covered elsewhere.
Roadmap or Changelog: Outline future plans or link to a CHANGELOG.md. Some READMEs link to a “Releases” page or a changelog file for those interested in version history (GraphQL .NET links upgrade guides for major versions
github.com
, and Ocelot keeps a separate ReleaseNotes file
github.com
).
Examples Repository: If your project has an examples/demo repo, mention it. GraphQL .NET lists several example projects and where to find them under an Examples section
github.com
.
Project Structure: In rare cases for complex apps, a brief overview of the repository structure or modules can help (though this is often in contributing docs rather than README).
Only add these if they provide value to the reader. Always consider if the main documentation site is more appropriate for extensive information.
Design, Formatting, and Visual Tips
Beyond content, the presentation of a README greatly affects readability and impression. The top README files use various formatting techniques to enhance clarity:
Badges: As mentioned, badges at the top provide a visual summary of project status (CI, version, downloads, etc.). They also break up text visually. Use shields.io or official badges from services. Ensure they are up-to-date (many update automatically). For example, Express shows build and coverage status with badges
github.com
, and Fastify includes a badge for its Discord chat and an Open Collective badge for sponsors
github.com
. Keep badges to a reasonable number; include those most relevant to users (test status, package version, license at minimum).
Emphasis and Icons: Use bold, italics, or emojis to draw attention where appropriate. Emojis can serve as section icons or to highlight warnings/tips in a friendly way. For instance, refine’s README uses a lightning emoji in “## ⚡ Try Refine” to make it eye-catching
github.com
. Don’t overdo emojis—use them sparingly for headers or to mark important notes, to maintain a professional feel.
Images and GIFs: Visual elements can significantly improve comprehension:
Screenshots: If your project has a UI (web dashboard, CLI output, etc.), include a screenshot. Place images in relevant sections (e.g., a screenshot of the app UI in an Examples or Features section). Make sure to add a descriptive alt text. The Ghost banner we embedded above is a good example of a promotional image that also conveys the UI style and integrated tools of the project
https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost
.
Animated GIFs: For showing an application in motion (such as a CLI tool usage or a quick demo of a web app), GIFs are extremely effective. Several “awesome README” examples highlight this: for instance, the README for a backup tool includes a short GIF demonstrating how it works
github.com
. A GIF in the README immediately shows the user what to expect upon running the tool. Keep GIFs short and to the point (few seconds, focusing on a single workflow).
Diagrams: If your project’s usage or architecture is complex, consider a simple diagram. Some READMEs include architecture flowcharts or integration diagrams (even ASCII or Mermaid diagrams). One project in the curated list had a Mermaid UML diagram to illustrate architecture
github.com
. Ensure diagrams are readable both in dark and light mode (GitHub’s default is light background for markdown content).
Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting: Always format code or commands as fenced code blocks with language hints (js, bash, ```python, etc.). This not only improves readability with syntax highlighting but also allows easy copy-pasting. The READMEs we studied consistently use code fences for installation commands and snippets (see the multiple examples like Express’s install command
github.com
 or Fastify’s code snippet
github.com
). Inline code (using backticks) is used for filenames, paths, or single commands in sentences (e.g., open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
github.com
).
Tables: When presenting structured information (feature comparison, compatibility matrix, etc.), use markdown tables. Fastify’s performance comparison is in a neat table format, making it easy to scan different frameworks and their metrics
github.com
. Another common table is listing components or packages in a monorepo (GraphQL .NET lists sub-packages with their NuGet download counts in a table
github.com
). Ensure to include a header row and use tables only for data that aligns naturally in columns.
Section Length and Flow: Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences) as a rule of thumb. Large blocks of text are intimidating on GitHub. Notice how the best READMEs break content into many discrete sections and lists, avoiding walls of text. Use headings (##, ###) liberally to separate topics. For example, HTTPie’s README splits out Features, Examples, Community, Contributing, About as distinct sections with just a few lines each
github.com
github.com
github.com
. This invites quick scanning.
Consistent Style: Maintain consistent markdown style – e.g., if you use sentence case for headings (“Getting started”), do so throughout; if you use title case (“Quick Start”), use it consistently. The tone and person (first person “we” vs. second person “you”) should also be consistent (more on tone below). Many projects adopt a direct second-person tone (“you can do X…”), which is naturally instructive.
By using these formatting techniques, you enhance both the aesthetic appeal and the usability of the README. A well-formatted README with visuals and clear code examples can significantly reduce the effort for newcomers to understand the project.
Language, Tone, and Style Recommendations
The tone of a README should be welcoming, clear, and concise. It should cater to both newcomers and experienced users scanning for specifics. Here are some style guidelines drawn from successful examples:
Be Friendly and Confident: Use an approachable tone. It’s common to write in either first person plural (“We created X to…”) or second person directing the user (“You can do Y with X”). For example, FastAPI’s tone is enthusiastic yet informative, even including testimonials in quotes to build trust
github.com
github.com
. Express’s language is straightforward and developer-friendly, with phrases like “the Express philosophy is…”
github.com
 that speak directly to the reader.
Clarity Over Hype: While it’s fine to highlight what makes your project great, avoid hyperbole without substance. Back claims with facts or links (as Fastify does with performance claims and benchmark links
github.com
). Keep language simple and avoid jargon where possible. If you must use domain-specific terms, consider linking to definitions or docs.
Active Voice: Write in active voice to keep sentences direct. For example, instead of “A detailed documentation is provided,” say “See the documentation for detailed guides.” Notice how README instructions often say “Run the server with:” or “Open your browser at http://….” – these are imperative and clear.
Encourage and Guide: Where relevant, encourage user engagement. For instance, NestJS’s README encourages joining their Discord for questions and explicitly states that GitHub issues are for bugs/feature requests
github.com
. This not only sets boundaries but does so in a polite way. Similarly, many READMEs encourage trying out examples or say things like “We’d love your feedback” in contributing.
Avoid Overwhelming Detail: A README should not read like full documentation. Opt for brevity and link out to more info. Django’s README is an example that keeps text minimal and defers to the docs for almost everything beyond installation and community help
github.com
github.com
. This works well for mature projects with extensive docs.
Professional but Not Stiff: Injecting a little personality is fine (a humorous aside or an emoji for a light touch), but maintain professionalism. The voice should reflect the project’s culture. If the project is enterprise-focused (like Ocelot .NET gateway), the tone can be more formal; if it’s a fun side project, a casual tone is acceptable. For instance, HTTPie’s README maintains a professional tone but still feels friendly and modern, consistent with calling itself “for the API era” and using phrases like “human-friendly”
github.com
.
Consistent Terminology: Make sure to refer to your product/project with a consistent name (match casing, spacing, etc., e.g., “FastAPI” not sometimes “fast API”). Also, if you refer to sections (like “see Installation below”), ensure those headings exist. Consistency extends to how you format code and paths too.
By following these style pointers, your README will be accessible and engaging. Remember, the README often forms the first impression – it should sound like a helpful maintainer walking the user through the basics, not an abstract manual or a marketing brochure alone.
Tailoring READMEs for Open-Source vs Internal Projects
There are subtle differences in emphasis when writing a README for an open-source project versus an internal (private or company-internal) project:
Audience: Open-source READMEs address a broad audience – any developer who might use or contribute to the project. Internal README audiences are your team or organization, who might already have context. As a result, an open-source README tends to be more explanatory about basics and setup (assuming nothing), whereas an internal README might assume knowledge of company-specific tools or dev environments.
Sections to Include: Almost all the sections discussed (Introduction, Installation, Usage, etc.) apply to both. However, open-source READMEs should include contributing guidelines, code of conduct, license, and community links because you expect external contributors and users. For example, all the top OSS READMEs we saw include license info and invite external contribution (Express, Fastify, NestJS, etc.). Internal project READMEs, on the other hand, might omit the license (or use a simple one-liner if proprietary) and will likely not include a “Contributing” section in the same way – contributions are usually handled via internal processes. Instead, an internal README might include company-specific details like how to deploy to internal servers, how to get access to credentials, or links to internal documentation portals.
Support Channels: In open source, support is via public forums (Issues, Discord, Stack Overflow). In an internal context, support might be via company Slack channels, or just by contacting the repository owners. Tailor this section accordingly. If writing an internal README, replace public links with internal ones (for example, “#devops Slack channel” instead of Discord, or a link to an internal wiki for troubleshooting known issues).
Tone Differences: Open-source projects tend to adopt an inviting tone as mentioned, because they want to build a community. Internal projects can be slightly more direct or terse since the readers are colleagues who just need information quickly. That said, it’s still best practice to be clear and friendly internally – it promotes a healthy engineering culture. Just be mindful of not disclosing any sensitive info in a README if the repo ever goes public.
Example Data: Open source README examples often use dummy or public endpoints (like FastAPI’s example uses 127.0.0.1:8000 and HTTPie uses httpie.io/hello and api.github.com in examples
github.com
github.com
). In an internal project, examples might refer to staging URLs or sample data relevant to your domain. Ensure internal examples won’t confuse external readers (if the repo is private, this is fine; if it might be open-sourced later, avoid internal URLs).
Security/Confidentiality: Open-source READMEs should not include secrets or anything confidential. Internal READMEs might include links to internal dashboards or mention proprietary systems (which is okay if the repo is private). Always review an internal README before open-sourcing a project to scrub such details and add the sections (like license) that open-source users expect.
In summary, the structure remains largely the same, but open-source READMEs put more weight on external onboarding (clear installation from scratch, welcoming tone, community and contribution info), whereas internal READMEs can focus on integration in the company’s ecosystem and assume a controlled set of users. Either way, clarity and completeness are paramount – internal projects benefit from good documentation just as open ones do.
Optional Enhancements to Consider
Finally, consider these extras that many top-notch README files utilize to stand out:
Project Shields and Icons: Aside from badges, some READMEs use custom shields or logos for section headings (for example, using an icon next to “License” or “Contributors”). Ensure these are accessible (provide alt text) and not overly distracting. The goal is to make sections easily identifiable at a glance.
Dynamic Content: Some projects include dynamic elements (updated nightly via CI), such as a graph of stars over time, or a list of recent contributors with avatars. For instance, one repository displays an auto-generated list of recent discussions or a star history chart
github.com
. These can impress, but require setup (GitHub Actions, etc.) and can clutter a README if overused. Use dynamic badges (like CI status, coverage) freely, but more complex dynamic inserts should be weighed against readability.
Changelog Link: If you maintain a changelog, link to it near the top (especially if users might be coming to the README for “What changed in the latest version?”). Some READMEs include a “See CHANGELOG for details” in the introduction or installation notes.
Release Highlights: In a project that does major releases, you might include a brief highlight of what’s new in the latest version, with a link to full release notes. This can help drive upgrades. For example, a README might say “🚀 v5.0 released! Now with TypeScript support – see the release notes for migration details.”
License Badges: In addition to a License section, many projects put a license badge at top for quick visibility. This is a small thing, but users often appreciate knowing at a glance if a project is MIT, Apache, etc. (It’s also often shown by GitHub UI as in the top bar of the repo.)
Internal Documentation Links: For internal projects, link to any internal docs or runbooks. E.g., “See the internal wiki page for deployment instructions” if that’s not public.
Remember that each additional element should serve a purpose. It’s easy to overload a README with too many images or sections, which can overwhelm readers. The best READMEs keep a balance – they are comprehensive but also skimmable.
By following these guidelines – as exemplified by the best README files of top web/API projects – you can create a README that effectively communicates your project’s value, makes it easy to get started, and encourages others to use and even contribute to the project. A well-structured README not only educates; it also conveys professionalism and care for your work. Whether your project is open source or internal, investing effort into a clear README will pay off by saving others (and yourself) time and confusion down the road. In summary, start with a strong introduction and visible key info (what the project does, why it’s awesome, how to get it), guide the user through setup and basic usage with examples, highlight important features, point to documentation and help, invite contributions if applicable, and close with licensing and credits. Use formatting and visuals to enhance understanding, and adopt a friendly, informative tone. A great README acts as both a roadmap and a handshake to your project – it should invite people in and show them around with confidence and clarity. Following the practices of the top projects in the field, you’ll ensure your README is not just read, but truly appreciated.
