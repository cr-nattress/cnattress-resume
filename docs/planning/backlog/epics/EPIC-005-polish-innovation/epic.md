2. Implement progressive enhancement (3D â†’ 2D fallback)
3. Use Workbox for intelligent caching strategy
4. Optimize images with next/image and WebP format
5. Code splitting for each major section
6. Implement edge caching on Netlify

### Performance Strategy

## Notes

This is the epic that transforms "good" into "unforgettable". Every detail matters here.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. 3D must enhance, not distract or slow down
2. Performance is non-negotiable - fast or don't ship
3. Accessibility must be perfect - no shortcuts
4. Easter eggs should delight, not confuse
5. Everything should feel polished and intentional

**Launch Readiness Criteria:**
- Lighthouse scores all green
- No console errors or warnings
- Tested on real devices (not just DevTools)
- SEO configured for discoverability
- Accessibility verified with real tools
- Performance tested on 3G connection
- Cross-browser tested (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Overusing 3D effects (causes performance issues)
- Ignoring accessibility for "fancy" features
- Not testing on real mobile devices
- Optimizing too early (before features complete)
- Forgetting about users with reduced motion preferences
