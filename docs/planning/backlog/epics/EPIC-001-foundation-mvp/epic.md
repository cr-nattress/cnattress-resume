# EPIC-001: Foundation MVP

**Epic ID:** EPIC-001
**Phase:** 1 - Foundation
**Timeline:** Week 1-2
**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ Critical
**Total Story Points:** 28

---

## Business Value

Establish the fundamental infrastructure and visual presence for the AI-enhanced portfolio website. This epic delivers a production-ready, beautiful landing page that makes a strong first impression while providing the technical foundation for all future features.

### Why This Matters

- **Speed to Market**: Get a live website deployed quickly to start building online presence
- **Foundation for Growth**: Proper setup prevents technical debt and enables rapid feature development
- **Professional Credibility**: A polished, responsive site demonstrates technical capability to recruiters
- **SEO Groundwork**: Early deployment allows search engines to begin indexing content

---

## Current State vs Target State

### Current State
- No website exists
- Portfolio content is scattered across various documents
- No online presence for recruiters to discover

### Target State
- Live, production website deployed at custom domain
- Responsive design working flawlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Core resume content (experience, skills, projects) beautifully presented
- Lighthouse performance score > 90
- All content indexed by search engines
- CI/CD pipeline automatically deploying updates

---

## Technical Approach

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Deployment**: Netlify with automatic CI/CD
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

### Architecture Decisions
1. Use Next.js App Router for modern React patterns and built-in optimizations
2. Implement mobile-first responsive design approach
3. Follow atomic design principles for component organization
4. Use TypeScript strict mode for type safety
5. Configure ESLint + Prettier for code quality

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Netlify deployment issues | High | Medium | Test deployment early, use preview deployments |
| Responsive design inconsistencies | Medium | Medium | Test on real devices, use BrowserStack |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Low | Implement lazy loading, optimize images early |
| Scope creep adding features | High | High | Stick to MVP features only, defer enhancements to later phases |
