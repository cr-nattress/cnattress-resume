## User Story

**As a** visitor to the portfolio website
**I want** to see a stunning, animated hero section with clear calls-to-action
**So that** I immediately understand who you are and what makes you unique

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hero section spans full viewport height (100vh)
- [ ] Gradient background (navy to deep purple) implemented
- [ ] Name and title/tagline prominently displayed with proper typography
- [ ] Three CTA buttons present and functional:
  - "Ask AI About Me" button (links to chat widget)
  - "Download Resume" button (downloads PDF)
  - "View Projects" button (smooth scrolls to projects section)
- [ ] Basic Framer Motion entrance animations implemented
- [ ] Smooth scroll functionality works for all navigation
- [ ] Fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Hero loads and animates within 1 second
- [ ] All text is readable with sufficient contrast

---

## Technical Notes

### Animation Requirements
Use Framer Motion for:
- Fade-in animation for name/title (duration: 0.6s)
- Slide-up animation for CTA buttons (staggered, 0.1s delay between each)
- Optional: Subtle floating animation for decorative elements

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile (< 768px): Stack elements vertically, reduce font sizes
- Tablet (768px - 1024px): Maintain layout, adjust spacing
- Desktop (> 1024px): Full layout with optimal spacing

### Accessibility
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 for name)
- ARIA labels for CTA buttons
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators visible

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Animations smooth and performant (60fps)
- [ ] Responsive design verified on 3+ screen sizes
- [ ] Smooth scroll navigation works

## Notes

**Key Success Factors:**
- Make the first impression count - this is what visitors see first
- Ensure animations are smooth and don't feel sluggish
- Mobile experience is just as important as desktop
- Test on real devices, not just browser DevTools

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use CSS for simple animations when possible
- Lazy load heavy 3D elements (can be added in Phase 5)
- Optimize font loading to prevent layout shift
