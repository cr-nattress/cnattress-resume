# EPIC-002: AI Integration

**Epic ID:** EPIC-002
**Phase:** 2 - AI Integration
**Timeline:** Week 3-4
**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ Critical
**Total Story Points:** 32

## Business Value

Integrate Claude AI to create an interactive career concierge chatbot that differentiates the portfolio from traditional resumes. This epic delivers the core "wow" factor that demonstrates AI expertise and provides unique value to recruiters.

### Why This Matters

- **Differentiation**: Only 1% of portfolios have working AI integration
- **Proof of Expertise**: Demonstrates actual AI implementation skills, not just claims
- **User Engagement**: Visitors can ask questions and get immediate, personalized answers
- **Lead Generation**: Analytics track visitor interests and conversation topics
- **Recruiter Value**: Answers "Does this candidate fit?" without scheduling calls

---

## Current State vs Target State

### Current State
- Static portfolio website deployed (EPIC-001 complete)
- No backend infrastructure or database
- No AI capabilities
- No visitor analytics

### Target State
- Supabase PostgreSQL database configured with schema
- Claude AI API integrated with streaming responses
- Persistent chat widget with minimize/maximize functionality
- Anonymous visitor analytics tracking engagement
- Chat conversations logged for improvement insights
- Admin dashboard showing analytics (hidden route)

---

## Technical Approach

### Tech Stack
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS)
- **Backend**: Netlify Serverless Functions
- **State Management**: React hooks + localStorage
- **Real-time**: Streaming responses from Claude API

### Architecture Decisions
1. Use Netlify Functions to keep API keys secure (never expose in client)
2. Implement streaming for real-time chat experience
3. Store chat history in Supabase for analytics and improvement
4. Use anonymous session IDs (no PII) for privacy
5. Build reusable context system for resume data

### Data Flow
```
User Input â†’ Chat Widget â†’ Netlify Function â†’ Claude API
                                â†“
                          Supabase (logs)
                                â†“
                        Analytics Dashboard
```

## Notes

This epic is what makes the portfolio unique and memorable. The AI chatbot is the killer feature that demonstrates real capability, not just claims on a resume.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. AI responses must be accurate and helpful
2. Chat widget should be persistent but not annoying
3. Keep API keys secure - never expose in client code
4. Build comprehensive context about skills and experience
5. Test conversations thoroughly before launch

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use streaming for better perceived performance
- Lazy load chat widget to not impact initial page load
- Cache common questions/responses if needed
- Implement rate limiting from day one
