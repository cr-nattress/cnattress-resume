# EPIC-003: Interactive Features

**Epic ID:** EPIC-003
**Phase:** 3 - Interactive Features
**Timeline:** Week 5-6
**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ High
**Total Story Points:** 31

## Business Value

Transform the static portfolio into an engaging, interactive experience that keeps visitors exploring and demonstrates modern frontend expertise. This epic adds the visual polish and interactivity that makes the portfolio memorable and shareable.

### Why This Matters

- **Engagement**: Interactive features increase average time on site by 3-5x
- **Differentiation**: 3D timeline and GitHub integration stand out from typical portfolios
- **Skill Demonstration**: Proves frontend mastery and attention to UX details
- **Shareability**: Impressive features encourage social sharing and referrals
- **SEO Benefit**: Longer engagement signals quality content to search engines

---

## Current State vs Target State

### Current State
- Static content sections (EPIC-001 complete)
- AI chatbot functional (EPIC-002 complete)
- Basic animations on hero section
- No data visualization
- No live GitHub integration

### Target State
- Interactive horizontal scrolling career timeline
- Expandable nodes with tech stack badges
- Filterable projects grid with modal details
- Live GitHub stats and contribution heatmap
- Scroll-triggered animations throughout site
- Parallax effects on hero section
- Smooth micro-interactions on all elements

---

## Technical Approach

### Tech Stack Additions
- **Framer Motion**: Advanced animations and transitions
- **React Hooks**: Custom hooks for scroll detection and intersection observers
- **GitHub API**: Live repository stats and activity
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Complex responsive layouts

### Architecture Decisions
1. Use IntersectionObserver for scroll-triggered animations
2. Implement horizontal scrolling with native CSS (better performance)
3. Cache GitHub API responses (1 hour TTL) to avoid rate limits
4. Lazy load timeline and projects for better initial performance
5. Use CSS transforms for animations (GPU acceleration)

### Performance Strategy
- Lazy load components below the fold
- Prefetch critical data on page load
- Use CSS containment for complex animations
- Implement virtualization if needed for long lists

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| GitHub API rate limiting | Medium | High | Cache responses, use authenticated requests |
| Animation performance on mobile | High | Medium | Test on real devices, optimize or disable if needed |
| Timeline complexity overwhelming | Low | Low | Keep UI simple, progressive disclosure |
| Projects grid not scalable | Low | Low | Implement pagination or "load more" |
| Scroll jank from heavy animations | High | Medium | Use CSS transforms, requestAnimationFrame |

## GitHub API Integration

### Endpoints to Use

**Get User Stats**:
```
GET https://api.github.com/users/{username}
```

**Get Repositories**:
```
GET https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos?sort=updated&per_page=10
```

**Get Contribution Activity**:
```
GET https://api.github.com/users/{username}/events/public?per_page=100
```

### Caching Strategy
```typescript
// Cache in memory or localStorage
interface GitHubCache {
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
  ttl: number; // 1 hour = 3600000ms
}
```

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Performance is critical - test on real devices
2. Timeline should be intuitive without instructions
3. Projects grid should showcase best work first
4. GitHub integration adds credibility and live data
5. Animations enhance, don't distract

**Performance Considerations:**
- Lazy load timeline and projects
- Use CSS transforms for smooth animations
- Cache GitHub data aggressively
- Test on mobile devices early
- Implement loading states for better perceived performance

**Accessibility Considerations:**
- Keyboard navigation for timeline
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Skip links for long scrolling sections
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
